(none)

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/sharpjs/Unindent/compare/release/1.0.0..release/1.1.0)
- Add leading newline removal.  `Unindent` will remove one leading newline, if
  present, from the input string.  This makes `Unindent` behave as advertised
  in the example given in the README file.
- Fix missing documentation.

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/sharpjs/Unindent/tree/release/1.0.0)
Initial release.
